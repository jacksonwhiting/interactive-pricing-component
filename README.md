## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Tailwind CSS
-  Vanilla Javascroipt

### What I learned

The challenge for me involved building the custom slider. I found many examples of custome built sliders online, but finally landed on one I liked and understood. The browser differences made it very complicated.

### Continued development

Keep working with javascript and building more complex UIs
